# a class on a glass of beer!
# my class will have simple attributes:  @drinkability(integer), @beer_level(integer), and @color(string)
# drinkability increases the changes of it being finished, so i'll have a method that interacts with that somehow
# i can have a method that checks the beer_level while it's being drunk, so give it a current state
# and a method that at least talks about the color
