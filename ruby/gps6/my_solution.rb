# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Danny Rosenfeld].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#  require_relative points to a data set or toolkit(instruction set) 
#   that resides within the working directory
#  it is subset of require, which just points to a data set or toolkit 
#   (instruction set) with the ruby program

require_relative 'state_data'

  #every state is initialized with state_of_origin, population_density, population input

    @population = population

  #which are both private methods below

# Reflection 



What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
