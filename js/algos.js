// In algos.js, write a function that takes an array of words or 
// phrases and returns the longest word in the array. So if we gave 
// your function the array of ["long phrase","longest phrase","longer 
// phrase"], it would return "longest phrase". This is a logical 
// reasoning challenge, so try to reason through this based on what 
// you already know, rather than Googling the fanciest solution or 
// looking up built-in sorting functions. Note that "some string".length 
// will do what you expect in JS.

/* 
set an empty variable to hold the longest word in the array
iterate over the array
get the length of each index of the array
put the first word in the array into the empty variable
if the second word length is longer than the first, replace that in the empty variable
continue iterating over the array until the longest word is in the empty variable
print the empty variable
*/



// Add driver code that tests your function on a few arrays.
