  <p>This is a footer that has my Release 4: Reflections</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I think that HTML5 semantic tags allow for better spacing and better flexibility of the page layouts than HTML4 can provide with forcing divider tags all over the place.  It seems like a more elequent way of writing out the HTML code.  I see the section tag as most helpful, based on the examples of the linked resource.  I see it as able to fluidly break a page into usable spaces more visaully cleaner.  I also like implicit ranking for headers, so you don't have to use ordered lists, etc.
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
      </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Elements can be nested, so it reads the first element, and finds any nested elements within it, in decending order, and so on until the elements close.  They close in order from the inner most nested to the first element.  Like this unoredered list, nested within an ordered list.  It displays the paragraph in the footer, followed by the first listed item of the ordered list, followed by the first listed item of the unordered list, until it closes, and a new listed item of the ordered list, etc.
            
          </li>
        </ul>
      <li>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>I learned that sublime is very specific about how it wants snippets to be made, and I learned that snippets are incredibly useful, and now that I know how to make them, I will certainly be adding them as I learn more code!</li>
        </ul>
      <li>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept? 
      </li>
        <ul>
          <li>I think that just getting to know the difference between HTML4 and HTML5 is still unclear, but I have the MDN, and W3 school to solidify those concepts so I can wrap my head around it a little better</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
