In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

	A virtual private server is a fully functional computer running an operating system on a remote host, that allows a user to create an environment that they can use for a multitude of things, without having to be constrained with actual hardware issues.  Since it is virtual, you can create as many as you need, or destroy them on command!  It is a virtual sandbox.
