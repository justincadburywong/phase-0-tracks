What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

	To understand what the Linux operating system was built on, we first have to understand the Unix OS.  Simply put, from my research, is that the Unix OS was designed with the idea that it doesn't shield the user from any parts of the OS, that the user is computer literate and knows what he or she is doing.  With that, and the Unix OS philosophies of modular, simple, flexible programmable concepts together help to build onto what is the Linux system.
	The Linux system treats all users as if they are power users.  It keeps things simple, by letting the user do most of the programming based on what he or she needs to accomplish.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

	A virtual private server is a fully functional computer running an operating system on a remote host, that allows a user to create an environment that they can use for a multitude of things, without having to be constrained with actual hardware issues.  Since it is virtual, you can create as many as you need, or destroy them on command!  It is a virtual sandbox.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

	running as the root overrides the security model that is meant to keep dumb people from doing dumb things.  while the freedom of having an OS that is designed for power users allows for the execution of all sorts of code, a novice might accidentally do something that would destroy the computer if run in the root user.
