	this website laid out a lot of info, mostly about what each series of codes represents.  they say:
	1xx - informational
	2xx - success
	3xx - redirection
	4xx - client error (errors 404(not found), 403(forbidden) etc)
	5xx - server error (500 internal server error)

GET and POST requests
	literally as they state, GET requests pull information from a remote server, and POST requests send info to the server from the client.
