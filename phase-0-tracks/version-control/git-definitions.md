# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

version control allows for a programmer to make a save point in writing their code.  it is useful because it allows a programmer to go back and implement code if they get off track or make mistakes along the way towards the goal. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

a branch is a copied state of the current code, and it allows one to make changes from that save point on.  it is useful because you can make large or small changes to the code without affecting the master code.


* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

a commit is a save point.  a good commit message will be detailed in what exactly changed in that save point.

* What is a merge conflict?

a merge conflict is the most common conflict, in which two branches being merged have different values on the same line.  git will show a conflict and pause the merge in order for someone to intervene and choose how they want to proceed, by either taking one, or the other value, or a new value completely.  this is done in a text editor, like sublime!
